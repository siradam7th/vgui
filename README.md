# What is vGUI?
**vGUI** is a modern-looking C++ UI library.  
It uses its own widget implementations instead of relying on platform-specific controls in order to achieve a consistent look.  
It can be extended using C++ features such as lambdas in order to create new widgets and features.  
It's a work-in-progress; put your seatbelt on, this is going to be a fun ride!

# Why vGUI?
**vGUI** was created to achieve the following goals:
- Consistent modern ui look and feel across platforms.
- Provide styling features with CSS-like API.
- Written in modern C++14 and C++17.
- A non-restrictive license *zlib*.

# When can i use it?
**vGUI** is still in its early development days so it's not a good idea to use it in any way other than testing,however it's under active
development so expect API breaking changes as in 1-commit-away-from-breaking style,but hopefully one day this section of the readme will cease to exist.
